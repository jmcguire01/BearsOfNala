# COVID19_Vis
# Provides a tool based on user selection to slice case/death data available in the United States by State or County level.
# The results generated provides four points for the user to examine:
#   1) The recent increase in cases in the past day
#   2) The running total cases by selection
#   3) A graph that shows the change over time of cases and death by selection
#   4) A table corresponding to the points on the graph
# 
# The difference in this data characterization versus most data presented, is the method of slicing. Data here is presented with a slice going back 1 week from the present,
# generating cases as a week's sum.
# 
# This is valuable to the users in evening out the fluctuations in the data due to lag in lab results postings and texting fluxuations. In addition, the data is a slice from
# the present moment, mitigating the impact of the current date falling in the earlier portion of the week. 
#
# This tool is still under improvement with eventual goals to provide more comparitive levels information to the user, informing of better forceasting, not limiting only to
# linear regression. Additionally, with providing rankings based on State vs County selection to inform how the location focus is performing.
